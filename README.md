## Description

Currently working in information technology, I am studying to become a full stack developer. I was born and raised in New Jersey but recently moved to Colorado with my lovely wife and dog. I graduated from New Jersey Institute of Technology with a degree in Computer Science. I spent most of my career at Lockheed Martin as an engineer until two years ago when I transitioned to PSEG as a technology engineer.
I pride myself on being a team player and enjoy collaborating with others. I love learning and you will often find me reading about topics that interest me such as hydroponics, philosophy, physics, technology and more. One of my goals is to create a nonprofit to help promote hydroponics in areas around the world with poor soil and water is sparse.
Interested by what you see? Reach out and letâ€™s discuss how I can contribute to your team.
